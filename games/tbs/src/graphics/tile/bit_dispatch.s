@ C2: Dispatcher enters Model_BitCommands' shared r0/r2/r3 decoder linkage;
@ bit_commands.s documents its unsaved r5 and ordinary fp mask.
@ In this file itself: it is a two-instruction fragment of that decoder, with
@ no prologue and no return of its own, and its tell is the computed pc into
@ code. and ip, r3, #7 / ldr pc, [pc, ip, lsl #2] is unconditional and has
@ no bounds test, where the compiler's casesi always emits cmp, ldrls pc and a
@ default branch; the table it indexes starts after the nop, in the next
@ object.
